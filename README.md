# J124 Final Project: California Wildfires
## By Ashley Dionicio

### Part One: The Data 
For my project I chose to use the California Wildfires Data. It includes information from 2013 through 2020. 
Link for the data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ananthu017/california-wildfire-incidents-20132020)
* Disclaimer: throughout this file I will be using wildfires and fire interchangeably


**Getting Started**
1. Download the Kaggle data as a csv file. 
2. Open a google sheets document and import the data. 
3. Using pivot tables, the refine tool, and sorting clean up the data provided. <br> 

_I was not able to find anything wrong with the data at **First**_ 

<br>

### Part Two: The Questions and Answers 
__Question One__: What is the year with the most fires? <br>
Process:
1. On original page (without having anything selected) go to data and select create pivot table in a new sheet
